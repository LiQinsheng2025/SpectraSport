# 🧠 Multispectral & Hyperspectral Imaging for Injury Detection in Sports

Multispectral and hyperspectral imaging (MSI/HSI) are revolutionizing how we detect and monitor sports injuries. This repository presents a cutting-edge framework combining spectral imaging with deep learning and physics-informed models to enable **real-time**, **non-invasive**, and **highly accurate** assessment of athletic injuries.

## 📌 Overview

Unlike traditional imaging tools such as MRI or X-ray, which are limited to static and anatomical evaluations, multispectral and hyperspectral imaging offer **dynamic**, **high-resolution spectral insights** into tissue composition and early-stage physiological changes.

This project introduces:

- A domain-specific model combining **deep learning-based feature extraction** and **physics-informed constraints**
- **Optimized preprocessing and data acquisition** pipelines for low-latency, on-field deployment
- A robust system for **motion estimation**, **object tracking**, and **real-time injury detection**

## 🚀 Features
